              <p>
                On September 3rd, 2024, a creative and engaging Logo Making
                Competition was organized as part of the ICE3T event. The
                competition centered around the "College Paper Publication"
                theme, with participants tasked to design logos that represented
                the diverse domains outlined on the ICE3T website. These domains
                ranged from cutting-edge technologies like Data Science, Cloud
                Computing, and IoT to traditional fields such as Civil
                Engineering and Indigenous Knowledge Systems, reflecting the
                broad spectrum of research areas. The three- hour event allowed
                participants ample time to ideate, sketch, and refine their
                designs. During the final hour, a submission form was
                circulated, enabling contestants to submit their completed
                logos. Judging criteria emphasized creativity, relevance to the
                theme, visual appeal, and the ability to effectively convey the
                essence of academic publication and research domains. The event
                showcased artistic innovation and technical understanding, with
                students demonstrating their design skills and ability to
                visually represent complex academic themes. After the event, one
                outstanding design was selected as the winner, highlighting the
                participant's exceptional creativity and alignment with the
                theme.
