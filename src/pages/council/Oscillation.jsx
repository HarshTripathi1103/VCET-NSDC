                OSCILLATIONS 2024, held on April 5th in collaboration with IETE
                Mumbai Centre, was a prestigious technical paper presentation
                event that offered students a platform to showcase their
                research, skills, and expertise. The event featured six diverse
                tracks, including mechanical systems, AI, IoT, civil
                engineering, and Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS). The
                inauguration was marked by traditional ceremonies, including the
                lighting of the ceremonial lamp and Saraswati Vandana, attended
                by dignitaries, faculty, and participants. Students presented
                their papers, evaluated on criteria such as originality,
                technical content, and presentation. The event concluded with a
                prize distribution, honoring winners across each track.
                OSCILLATIONS 2024 encouraged interdisciplinary knowledge
                exchange, fostering innovation and critical thinking, while
                inspiring participants to continue pushing the boundaries of
                research and technology to tackle real-world challenges.
